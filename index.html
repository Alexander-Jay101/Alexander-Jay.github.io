                                <p>It's been a pleasure to have Alex intern with us at Career Ready, but on top of the pleasure
                                    he has brought real value. He listens, focuses and gets on with his tasks in a mature,
                                    independent way. Alex's initial shyness evaporated as he took on a video filming task with
                                    eight of our corporate supporters. This required journeys across London to businesses he'd
                                    never visited to interview students he had never met. At the beginning he admitted not
                                    wanting to interview anyone; by the end he was bombarding them with questions. His
                                    analytical approach to work and his easy manner should bring real success in the field of
                                    cyber-security where he hopes to work.</p>

                                <h2>Third sector communicator at Career Ready</h2>
                                <p>I had the pleasure of supervising Alex during his paid internship at
                                    Career Ready in the summer of 2018. During his four-weeks with us, Alex displayed a level of
                                    maturity and workplace skills far above what you would expect of a person his age. Alex
                                    provided much-neededsupport with a wide range of communication and marketing activities,
                                    specifically in regard to social media activity; video editing; writing to key stakeholders;
                                    photography; and providing insight and assistance on our digital projects. Alex also
                                    displayed the ability -and willingness - to manage his own projects and work independently,
                                    only asking for assistance when required. This experience of project management and his
                                    ability to quickly learn new things in the workplace will make him a positive addition to
                                    any team. In addition, he was always willing to provide support to the wider organisation.

                                <p>Alex has been a delight to teach; his enthusiasm, initiative and determination to seize all
                                    opportunities coming his way with both hands and his 100% commitment ensure that he is an
                                    asset to whichever organisation he works for. He has taken up work experience opportunities,
                                    paid and unpaid, in both the corporate, commercial and voluntary sector across a wide range
                                    of disciplines, eg: network and installation, security, social media and web. He is always
                                    willing and helpful with the ability to get on with others from a diverse range of
                                    backgrounds, and is a genuinely nice person, always willing to help or coach others. He
                                    produces work of high quality, and has very good problem-solving skills. I would not
                                    hesitate to recommend Alex for anything to which he has put his mind. </p>

                                <p>I can't speak highly enough of Alex. I had the opportunity to mentor Alex via his college and it was an absolute pleasure. 
                                   Alex has a great can do attitude and is willing to accept being put out of his comfort zone. As part of the mentoring process I managed to get Alex to present to a number of business owners within a networking group. Alex took this whole process in his stride.
                                   Anyone who employs Alex would add a very valuable person to a team. If the opportunity came up to get Alex into my business I would not hesitate.
